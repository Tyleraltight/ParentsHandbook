At the 13-minute mark, there's a sex scene between a couple that lasts about a minute. It is mostly seen from behind but she is topless and you see the side of a breast. Her thrusting is shown. No male nudity. This is the only sex scene in the film.

When violence occurs, there is no soundtrack or score so it's significantly more disturbing and realistic.
